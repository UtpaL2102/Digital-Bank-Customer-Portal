üìò Digital Bank ‚Äì Complete Knowledge Base

This document describes the entire customer journey, processes, and system messages of Digital Bank, as represented in the user interface. It covers account creation, KYC verification, login security, dashboard overview, transactions, and transfers.

1. Account Creation

Digital Bank allows users to open an account online through a two-step process:

Step 1 ‚Äì Basic Details

Customers are required to fill in the following information:

Full Name

Enter your legal name exactly as it appears on your official documents.

Example: Alex Johnson.

This name will appear on your bank profile, debit card, and statements.

Email Address

Provide a valid and active email address.

This will be used for:

Account activation

Login communication

Security alerts

Password recovery

Phone Number

Enter your mobile number with country code.

Example: +1 202 555 0199.

SMS OTPs and important notifications will be sent to this number.

Password Creation

Must be at least 8 characters long.

Strongly recommended: use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Example: MyBank@123.

Confirm Password

Re-enter the password to confirm.

If the two passwords do not match, an error will be shown.

Terms & Privacy Policy Agreement

Customers must tick the checkbox ‚ÄúI agree to the Terms & Privacy Policy‚Äù.

Without agreement, the account cannot be created.

‚û° Once all fields are correctly filled, the customer clicks Continue to move to Step 2.

Step 2 ‚Äì KYC Verification

To comply with regulations, Digital Bank requires KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.

Personal Information Required:

ID Type: Select from Passport, Driver‚Äôs License, National ID, etc.

ID Number: Enter exactly as printed on the ID.

Date of Birth: Format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 1995-04-20).

Residential Address:

Address Line 1 (Street, building, house number)

City

State/Province

Postal Code

Document Uploads Required:

Government ID (Front and Back)

Customers must upload a clear scan/photo.

Accepted formats: Passport, Driver‚Äôs License, National ID.

Address Proof

Utility bill, bank statement, or rental agreement.

The document must show the same address entered in the form.

Live Selfie Verification

Customers must enable their camera and capture a live selfie.

This is compared with the government ID photo to ensure identity.

Consent:

Before submission, users must tick ‚ÄúI consent to identity verification and data processing.‚Äù

KYC Status Indicators (Right Panel):

Not Started (Grey) ‚Äì KYC has not yet begun.

Verifying‚Ä¶ (Blue) ‚Äì Documents are under review.

Verified (Green) ‚Äì KYC successfully completed.

Failed (Mismatch) (Red) ‚Äì The submitted documents or selfie did not pass verification.

Each KYC attempt generates a Verification ID (e.g., KYC-2025-000142) and a Confidence Score (e.g., 0.92).

Higher scores mean greater certainty that documents are valid.

Customers are notified via email/SMS when KYC completes.

Tips for Successful KYC Submission:

Ensure good lighting when taking a selfie.

Make sure the address matches exactly with proof document.

Do not wear hats, sunglasses, or anything that hides your face.

KYC Result and Resubmission

If KYC verification fails, the customer will see a KYC Status Page with detailed results:

Verification Timeline

Submitted ‚úî

Documents Verified ‚úî

Selfie Mismatch ‚ùå

Current Result Details

Verification ID: KYC-2025-000142

Confidence Score: 0.76

Notes: Face not clearly visible

The customer must click Resubmit KYC and upload new documents or take a clearer selfie.

2. Security
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Digital Bank enforces strong login security with 2FA.

After entering username and password, users must provide a 6-digit verification code generated by their authenticator app.

If the authenticator app is not accessible, a backup code can be used.

The option ‚ÄúRemember this device for 30 days‚Äù allows skipping 2FA for trusted devices.

Without correct 2FA verification, login and sensitive actions (like transfers) cannot proceed.

1. Help & Chatbot Customer Support Interface

At the top of the section, the title reads ‚ÄúHelp & Chatbot‚Äù, indicating this is a place where users can ask questions related to banking services such as debit cards, net banking, transfers, daily limits, security, etc.

The chatbot interaction starts with a greeting message displayed automatically by the bot:

‚ÄúHi! How can I help today?‚Äù ‚Äì A polite prompt encouraging users to ask their queries.

Below the greeting, users can type their questions in a message input box.
Example interaction flow:

User asks: ‚ÄúHow to increase daily limit?‚Äù

Bot responds:
‚ÄúGo to Limits ‚Üí Request increase. We‚Äôll review in 1‚Äì2 days.‚Äù

A confidence score appears next to the bot‚Äôs answer (e.g., Confidence: 0.92), showing the reliability of the response.

Beneath the conversation, quick suggestion buttons are provided for common actions:

‚ÄúReset debit PIN‚Äù

‚ÄúNet banking activation‚Äù

‚ÄúLow balance alerts‚Äù

Purpose: These allow users to get fast responses without typing full queries.

Finally, the interface offers an escalation option to human support.

A small note: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll log your chats to chatbot_logs‚Äù (for monitoring purposes).

A text input area with placeholder text ‚ÄúType your message‚Ä¶‚Äù where users can type more detailed or unusual questions.

A blue send button (arrow icon) to submit the query.

üîµ 2. Notifications Page Interface

A section labeled ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù shows important user alerts related to their banking account.

The top area provides filtering options:

Two tabs: ‚ÄúAll‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnread‚Äù ‚Äì Let users toggle between viewing all notifications or only those not read yet.

A clickable link: ‚ÄúMark all read‚Äù ‚Äì Allows marking all notifications as read in one click.

The notifications list shows individual items with:

Color-coded indicators:

Green dot: Indicates a successful action (e.g., Transfer completed).

Orange dot: Cautionary info (e.g., Daily limit nearing max).

Blue dot: Informational status (e.g., KYC verification completed).

Red dot: Important warnings (e.g., Login attempt blocked).

Each notification shows:

A brief message (e.g., ‚ÄúTransfer completed‚Äù).

A detailed context line:

Transaction ID (e.g., TRX-22481)

Target account (e.g., Savings)

Time stamp (e.g., ‚Äú2 min ago‚Äù, ‚Äú1 hr ago‚Äù, ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù).

Purpose: This interface keeps customers well informed in a transparent manner about their account activities and system events.

üîµ 3. Notification Preferences Page

At the top, a header: ‚ÄúNotification preferences‚Äù highlights that users can customize how they receive alerts.

Two main sections are available:

Channels ‚Äì Method by which users want to receive notifications:

Email (Enabled by default).

SMS (Disabled by default).

In-app (Enabled by default).

Users toggle these options on or off depending on their preferences.


Alert Types ‚Äì Categories of events the user wishes to be notified about:

Transactions (On): Notify when transactions happen.

Low balance (On): Notify when balance is low.

Security (On): Notify about security-related events.

Below that, an input field labeled ‚ÄúLow balance threshold‚Äù:

Allows user to set a monetary amount (example: $100.00).

Purpose: System alerts the user when the balance falls below this threshold.

üîµ 4. Request Limit Increase Interface

The form is used by customers who want to increase their allowed transaction limits.

Three input fields:

New daily limit:

Input box where customers specify the new desired daily transaction limit (example: $7,500).

New monthly limit:

Input box where customers specify the new desired monthly transaction limit (example: $30,000).

Reason:

A text area where customers must enter a justification for their request (e.g., ‚ÄúHigher business payments‚Äù).

Below these fields are two action buttons:

Close (Grey button): Cancels the request without sending it.

Send (Blue button): Submits the limit increase request to the bank‚Äôs system for review.

Purpose: This form helps users escalate their request for higher limits securely.

üîµ 5. Admin Limit Approval Interface

Dedicated interface for bank administrators to review limit increase requests submitted by customers.

At the top, the title reads:
‚ÄúReview request LR-0012‚Äù (where LR-0012 is the unique request ID).

The interface provides full context of the request:

User email: alex@db.com

Current limits:

$25,000 monthly

Requested limits:

$7,500 daily

Admins can leave their internal decision notes in a text area.

Below the notes section, two action buttons:

Decline (Red button): To reject the limit increase request.

Approve (Green button): To accept the limit increase request.

Purpose: This ensures proper human review and auditability of sensitive operations.

üîµ 6. Reset Password Flow Interface

Allows customers to reset their password securely.

Instructions displayed at the top:
‚ÄúWe sent a 6-digit code to your email.‚Äù

Six individual input boxes where the user enters the verification code digit by digit.

Below that, two input fields:

New password: Enter the new desired password.

Confirm new password: Re-enter the new password to confirm accuracy.

A large blue button:
‚ÄúReset password‚Äù ‚Äì Submits the verification code and new password to update the user account.

Purpose: Prevents unauthorized access by verifying the customer‚Äôs identity through the emailed code.

‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì How All This Works Together

Customer Support:

The chatbot acts as the first line of support for general questions (limits, net banking, alerts).

The system provides confidence scores and suggested actions for simplicity.

Escalation option exists for more complex issues to human agents.

Notifications System:

Customers receive real-time alerts about:

Transactions

KYC status

Login issues

Limit warnings

They can filter, read, and mark them as read.

Alert Configuration:

Users fully control their alert preferences:

Channels (Email/SMS/In-app).

Types of alerts.

Balance threshold to trigger warnings.

Limit Management:

Customers request increases via a form.

Admins can review and approve or decline requests.

Admin decision notes are stored for auditing purposes.

Security Management:

Password reset via OTP ensures security.

Users input a 6-digit code and reset their password securely.
1. Forgot Password Page

The Forgot Password page is designed to help users regain access to their account in case they have forgotten their login credentials. On this page, the user is presented with a simple form titled ‚ÄúForgot password.‚Äù The main instruction clearly explains the process: ‚ÄúEnter your email and we‚Äôll send a verification code.‚Äù This means that the system is configured to verify the user‚Äôs identity via their registered email address before allowing any password reset to take place.

There is a single input field on this page where the user needs to type their email address. The placeholder text inside the field (you@domain.com) acts as a hint for users, showing the required format. Once the user enters their email, they need to click on the large blue ‚ÄúSend code‚Äù button.

After pressing this button, the system performs a check: if the email exists in the bank‚Äôs database and is linked to a valid account, then a verification code is immediately sent to that email. This verification code is a randomly generated string of numbers or alphanumeric characters, and it is usually valid only for a short period (for example, 5‚Äì10 minutes). This time limitation ensures better security so that even if someone intercepts the code, they cannot reuse it later.

The next step, not shown in this screenshot but implied, is that the user will be redirected to a verification screen where they must enter the code they received in their email. Once they enter the correct code, the system will allow them to create a new password. The new password must meet the bank‚Äôs password policy, which usually includes rules like: minimum 8‚Äì10 characters, must contain uppercase and lowercase letters, at least one number, and a special character. If the entered code is wrong or expired, the system will reject it, and the user will need to request a new one.

This entire flow ensures that only the genuine account holder who has access to the registered email can reset the password, thereby protecting the account from unauthorized access.

2. Help Center / FAQs Page

The Help Center is one of the most important sections of the Digital Bank website, as it provides self-service customer support for users who may face issues or have questions. The page is structured in a way that allows customers to find answers quickly without needing to call support.

At the top of the page, there is a search bar. This allows users to type in keywords like ‚Äúdebit card,‚Äù ‚Äúnet banking,‚Äù or ‚Äúlimits.‚Äù When they type their query, the system searches through the knowledge base of frequently asked questions and provides the most relevant answers. On the right-hand side of the search bar, there is a button labeled ‚ÄúAsk bot.‚Äù This is designed to redirect the user to the AI chatbot, which can answer questions in a more conversational way, especially when FAQs do not fully address the issue.

Below the search bar, there are multiple categories presented as clickable tabs:

Debit cards ‚Äì all questions related to card usage, PIN reset, blocking a lost card, transaction limits, etc.

Net banking ‚Äì setup, login, enabling/disabling, password reset, etc.

Transfers ‚Äì covers daily transfer limits, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, UPI issues, etc.

KYC & limits ‚Äì information about account verification, daily transaction limits, documentation required, etc.

Loans ‚Äì queries related to loan applications, repayments, interest rates, and closing a loan.

The Top Results section shows the most commonly searched and important questions:

How do I reset my debit card PIN?
The answer provides step-by-step instructions: Go to the Cards section ‚Üí Select the specific card ‚Üí Choose ‚ÄúReset PIN‚Äù ‚Üí The system sends an OTP (One-Time Password) to the registered mobile number ‚Üí Enter OTP ‚Üí Set a new PIN.

How can I increase my daily transfer limit?
The answer guides the user to open the Limits page ‚Üí Select ‚ÄúRequest Increase‚Äù ‚Üí Submit request ‚Üí Wait for approval, which normally takes 1‚Äì2 working days. Once approved, the user will get confirmation via SMS or email.

How do I enable net banking?
The process involves going to the Profile section ‚Üí Navigating to Security settings ‚Üí Enabling ‚ÄúNet banking‚Äù ‚Üí Setting up a username and password for internet banking. This setup allows the user to perform online transactions securely.

The Help Center ensures that customers have clear, step-by-step solutions for the most frequent issues, reducing dependency on human agents and empowering users to resolve problems themselves.

3. Chat History Page

The Chat History page records and displays all past interactions between the user and the bank‚Äôs chatbot. This feature adds transparency and allows users to revisit old queries without having to ask the same question again.

At the top of this page, there are filters that make it easier to navigate the history. Users can:

Search specific queries using keywords.

Filter chats by confidence level (for example, showing only answers where the AI was ‚â• 80% confident).

Select a date range, such as the last 30 days, to review only recent chats.

The chat history is shown in a table format with the following details:

Created ‚Äì Timestamp of when the query was made. For example, ‚Äú2025-08-10 14:12.‚Äù

Question ‚Äì The exact text typed by the user, e.g., ‚ÄúIncrease daily limit?‚Äù

Answer (snippet) ‚Äì A shortened version of the AI‚Äôs response, such as ‚ÄúGo to Limits ‚Üí Request increase‚Ä¶‚Äù

Confidence ‚Äì A score between 0 and 1 showing how confident the AI was in its answer. For example, 0.92 (92% confident).

Ref ‚Äì An internal reference code, such as FAQ IDs or KYC IDs, which map the question to a specific knowledge base entry.

Example:

On 2025-08-10 at 14:12, the user asked, ‚ÄúIncrease daily limit?‚Äù The chatbot answered, ‚ÄúGo to Limits ‚Üí Request increase‚Ä¶‚Äù with a confidence of 0.92. Reference ID: KYC-2025-142.

On 2025-08-09 at 10:05, the user asked, ‚ÄúReset debit PIN.‚Äù The chatbot responded with, ‚ÄúOpen Cards ‚Üí Reset PIN‚Ä¶‚Äù with confidence 0.95. Reference ID: FAQ-34.

This page is not only useful for customers but also for administrators, who can monitor the chatbot‚Äôs performance, identify gaps, and improve the training data where confidence scores are low.

4. Profile & Security Page

The Profile & Security page is the central hub for managing account-related details and enhancing account protection. It is divided into three main sections:

A. Personal Information

Here, users can view and update their Full Name, Phone Number, and Email Address. These details are crucial as they are used for communication, verification, and recovery purposes. For example, if the user changes their phone number, OTPs and alerts will start going to the new number. After making any changes, the user must click the ‚ÄúSave changes‚Äù button to confirm updates.

B. Change Password

This section allows users to change their login password. To do this, the user must enter their Current Password, then type a New Password, and retype it in the Confirm field. This process ensures the user is authenticated before changing credentials. The system also enforces password policies such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

C. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This is an advanced security feature that adds another layer of protection beyond just the password. The user can toggle 2FA ON or OFF. When enabled, even if someone knows the password, they cannot log in without the second factor.

Methods:

Authenticator App ‚Äì The system generates a QR code, which the user scans in an authentication app like Google Authenticator. This app then generates one-time codes that the user must enter at login.

Backup Codes ‚Äì In case the user loses access to their authenticator app, they can download backup codes. Each code can be used once for login.

This ensures that the account is safe from unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised.

5. Active Sessions Page

The Active Sessions page provides transparency about which devices are currently logged into the user‚Äôs account. This is important for detecting suspicious activity and protecting the user from fraud.

The data is shown in a table with columns:

Example questions it can answer:

‚ÄúHow do I add a new beneficiary?‚Äù ‚Üí Walkthrough of Add Beneficiary page.

‚ÄúWhere can I check audit logs?‚Äù ‚Üí Admin Dashboard > Audit logs section.

‚ÄúWhat do I do if I see 403 error?‚Äù ‚Üí Click ‚ÄúRequest access‚Äù.

‚ÄúHow do I start a money transfer?‚Äù ‚Üí Dashboard > New Transfer > Fill fields > Next.

üëâ Bro, do you want me to continue building this long doc as you upload more UI pages, or should I already start compiling this into a single fine-tuning ready text file (like .txt or .md) for you?

You said:
long explanatinatory vrisoon not short pls
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç got it bro. You don‚Äôt want just a short structured doc, but a long, explanatory, step-by-step version that reads more like a full training manual / help center guide. This way, when you fine-tune your chatbot, it will be able to give detailed answers with reasoning and context, not just 2-line replies.

Here‚Äôs the expanded explanatory version of the same UI screens you shared:

üìò Digital Bank ‚Äì Full Explanatory Documentation
1. Add Beneficiary Page

Fill in Beneficiary Details

Name: Enter the full name of the person or business you want to send money to. The name should match the one registered with their bank.

Account Number: Enter the beneficiary‚Äôs bank account number. This is the most critical field since any error here may cause failed or misdirected transfers.

Bank: Provide the name of the bank where the beneficiary holds their account.

IFSC/SWIFT Code:

If the transfer is domestic, enter the IFSC code (Indian Financial System Code).

If the transfer is international, enter the SWIFT code, which is used for global transfers.

Description (Optional): This is an optional field where the customer can add notes. For example: ‚ÄúRent payment‚Äù or ‚ÄúJohn ‚Äì College fees.‚Äù

Submit or Cancel

Save (Blue Button): Clicking this will add the beneficiary to the customer‚Äôs account list. The beneficiary can then be selected during fund transfers.

Cancel (Grey Button): If the customer changes their mind, they can cancel without saving the details.
