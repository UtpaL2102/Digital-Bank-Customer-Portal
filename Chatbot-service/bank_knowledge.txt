📘 Digital Bank – Complete Knowledge Base

This document describes the entire customer journey, processes, and system messages of Digital Bank, as represented in the user interface. It covers account creation, KYC verification, login security, dashboard overview, transactions, and transfers.

1. Account Creation

Digital Bank allows users to open an account online through a two-step process:

Step 1 – Basic Details

Customers are required to fill in the following information:

Full Name

Enter your legal name exactly as it appears on your official documents.

Example: Alex Johnson.

This name will appear on your bank profile, debit card, and statements.

Email Address

Provide a valid and active email address.

This will be used for:

Account activation

Login communication

Security alerts

Password recovery

Phone Number

Enter your mobile number with country code.

Example: +1 202 555 0199.

SMS OTPs and important notifications will be sent to this number.

Password Creation

Must be at least 8 characters long.

Strongly recommended: use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Example: MyBank@123.

Confirm Password

Re-enter the password to confirm.

If the two passwords do not match, an error will be shown.

Terms & Privacy Policy Agreement

Customers must tick the checkbox “I agree to the Terms & Privacy Policy”.

Without agreement, the account cannot be created.

➡ Once all fields are correctly filled, the customer clicks Continue to move to Step 2.

Step 2 – KYC Verification

To comply with regulations, Digital Bank requires KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.

Personal Information Required:

ID Type: Select from Passport, Driver’s License, National ID, etc.

ID Number: Enter exactly as printed on the ID.

Date of Birth: Format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 1995-04-20).

Residential Address:

Address Line 1 (Street, building, house number)

City

State/Province

Postal Code

Document Uploads Required:

Government ID (Front and Back)

Customers must upload a clear scan/photo.

Accepted formats: Passport, Driver’s License, National ID.

Address Proof

Utility bill, bank statement, or rental agreement.

The document must show the same address entered in the form.

Live Selfie Verification

Customers must enable their camera and capture a live selfie.

This is compared with the government ID photo to ensure identity.

Consent:

Before submission, users must tick “I consent to identity verification and data processing.”

KYC Status Indicators (Right Panel):

Not Started (Grey) – KYC has not yet begun.

Verifying… (Blue) – Documents are under review.

Verified (Green) – KYC successfully completed.

Failed (Mismatch) (Red) – The submitted documents or selfie did not pass verification.

Each KYC attempt generates a Verification ID (e.g., KYC-2025-000142) and a Confidence Score (e.g., 0.92).

Higher scores mean greater certainty that documents are valid.

Customers are notified via email/SMS when KYC completes.

Tips for Successful KYC Submission:

Ensure good lighting when taking a selfie.

Make sure the address matches exactly with proof document.

Do not wear hats, sunglasses, or anything that hides your face.

KYC Result and Resubmission

If KYC verification fails, the customer will see a KYC Status Page with detailed results:

Verification Timeline

Submitted ✔

Documents Verified ✔

Selfie Mismatch ❌

Current Result Details

Verification ID: KYC-2025-000142

Confidence Score: 0.76

Notes: Face not clearly visible

The customer must click Resubmit KYC and upload new documents or take a clearer selfie.

2. Security
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Digital Bank enforces strong login security with 2FA.

After entering username and password, users must provide a 6-digit verification code generated by their authenticator app.

If the authenticator app is not accessible, a backup code can be used.

The option “Remember this device for 30 days” allows skipping 2FA for trusted devices.

Without correct 2FA verification, login and sensitive actions (like transfers) cannot proceed.

1. Help & Chatbot Customer Support Interface

At the top of the section, the title reads “Help & Chatbot”, indicating this is a place where users can ask questions related to banking services such as debit cards, net banking, transfers, daily limits, security, etc.

The chatbot interaction starts with a greeting message displayed automatically by the bot:

“Hi! How can I help today?” – A polite prompt encouraging users to ask their queries.

Below the greeting, users can type their questions in a message input box.
Example interaction flow:

User asks: “How to increase daily limit?”

Bot responds:
“Go to Limits → Request increase. We’ll review in 1–2 days.”

A confidence score appears next to the bot’s answer (e.g., Confidence: 0.92), showing the reliability of the response.

Beneath the conversation, quick suggestion buttons are provided for common actions:

“Reset debit PIN”

“Net banking activation”

“Low balance alerts”

Purpose: These allow users to get fast responses without typing full queries.

Finally, the interface offers an escalation option to human support.

A small note: “We’ll log your chats to chatbot_logs” (for monitoring purposes).

A text input area with placeholder text “Type your message…” where users can type more detailed or unusual questions.

A blue send button (arrow icon) to submit the query.

🔵 2. Notifications Page Interface

A section labeled “Notifications” shows important user alerts related to their banking account.

The top area provides filtering options:

Two tabs: “All” and “Unread” – Let users toggle between viewing all notifications or only those not read yet.

A clickable link: “Mark all read” – Allows marking all notifications as read in one click.

The notifications list shows individual items with:

Color-coded indicators:

Green dot: Indicates a successful action (e.g., Transfer completed).

Orange dot: Cautionary info (e.g., Daily limit nearing max).

Blue dot: Informational status (e.g., KYC verification completed).

Red dot: Important warnings (e.g., Login attempt blocked).

Each notification shows:

A brief message (e.g., “Transfer completed”).

A detailed context line:

Transaction ID (e.g., TRX-22481)

Target account (e.g., Savings)

Time stamp (e.g., “2 min ago”, “1 hr ago”, “Yesterday”).

Purpose: This interface keeps customers well informed in a transparent manner about their account activities and system events.

🔵 3. Notification Preferences Page

At the top, a header: “Notification preferences” highlights that users can customize how they receive alerts.

Two main sections are available:

Channels – Method by which users want to receive notifications:

Email (Enabled by default).

SMS (Disabled by default).

In-app (Enabled by default).

Users toggle these options on or off depending on their preferences.


Alert Types – Categories of events the user wishes to be notified about:

Transactions (On): Notify when transactions happen.

Low balance (On): Notify when balance is low.

Security (On): Notify about security-related events.

Below that, an input field labeled “Low balance threshold”:

Allows user to set a monetary amount (example: $100.00).

Purpose: System alerts the user when the balance falls below this threshold.

🔵 4. Request Limit Increase Interface

The form is used by customers who want to increase their allowed transaction limits.

Three input fields:

New daily limit:

Input box where customers specify the new desired daily transaction limit (example: $7,500).

New monthly limit:

Input box where customers specify the new desired monthly transaction limit (example: $30,000).

Reason:

A text area where customers must enter a justification for their request (e.g., “Higher business payments”).

Below these fields are two action buttons:

Close (Grey button): Cancels the request without sending it.

Send (Blue button): Submits the limit increase request to the bank’s system for review.

Purpose: This form helps users escalate their request for higher limits securely.

🔵 5. Admin Limit Approval Interface

Dedicated interface for bank administrators to review limit increase requests submitted by customers.

At the top, the title reads:
“Review request LR-0012” (where LR-0012 is the unique request ID).

The interface provides full context of the request:

User email: alex@db.com

Current limits:

$5,000 daily

$25,000 monthly

Requested limits:

$7,500 daily

$30,000 monthly

Reason: Provided by the customer, e.g., “Higher payroll”.

Admins can leave their internal decision notes in a text area.

Below the notes section, two action buttons:

Decline (Red button): To reject the limit increase request.

Approve (Green button): To accept the limit increase request.

Purpose: This ensures proper human review and auditability of sensitive operations.

🔵 6. Reset Password Flow Interface

Allows customers to reset their password securely.

Instructions displayed at the top:
“We sent a 6-digit code to your email.”

Six individual input boxes where the user enters the verification code digit by digit.

Below that, two input fields:

New password: Enter the new desired password.

Confirm new password: Re-enter the new password to confirm accuracy.

A large blue button:
“Reset password” – Submits the verification code and new password to update the user account.

Purpose: Prevents unauthorized access by verifying the customer’s identity through the emailed code.

✅ Summary – How All This Works Together

Customer Support:

The chatbot acts as the first line of support for general questions (limits, net banking, alerts).

The system provides confidence scores and suggested actions for simplicity.

Escalation option exists for more complex issues to human agents.

Notifications System:

Customers receive real-time alerts about:

Transactions

KYC status

Login issues

Limit warnings

They can filter, read, and mark them as read.

Alert Configuration:

Users fully control their alert preferences:

Channels (Email/SMS/In-app).

Types of alerts.

Balance threshold to trigger warnings.

Limit Management:

Customers request increases via a form.

Admins can review and approve or decline requests.

Admin decision notes are stored for auditing purposes.

Security Management:

Password reset via OTP ensures security.

Users input a 6-digit code and reset their password securely.
1. Forgot Password Page

The Forgot Password page is designed to help users regain access to their account in case they have forgotten their login credentials. On this page, the user is presented with a simple form titled “Forgot password.” The main instruction clearly explains the process: “Enter your email and we’ll send a verification code.” This means that the system is configured to verify the user’s identity via their registered email address before allowing any password reset to take place.

There is a single input field on this page where the user needs to type their email address. The placeholder text inside the field (you@domain.com) acts as a hint for users, showing the required format. Once the user enters their email, they need to click on the large blue “Send code” button.

After pressing this button, the system performs a check: if the email exists in the bank’s database and is linked to a valid account, then a verification code is immediately sent to that email. This verification code is a randomly generated string of numbers or alphanumeric characters, and it is usually valid only for a short period (for example, 5–10 minutes). This time limitation ensures better security so that even if someone intercepts the code, they cannot reuse it later.

The next step, not shown in this screenshot but implied, is that the user will be redirected to a verification screen where they must enter the code they received in their email. Once they enter the correct code, the system will allow them to create a new password. The new password must meet the bank’s password policy, which usually includes rules like: minimum 8–10 characters, must contain uppercase and lowercase letters, at least one number, and a special character. If the entered code is wrong or expired, the system will reject it, and the user will need to request a new one.

This entire flow ensures that only the genuine account holder who has access to the registered email can reset the password, thereby protecting the account from unauthorized access.

2. Help Center / FAQs Page

The Help Center is one of the most important sections of the Digital Bank website, as it provides self-service customer support for users who may face issues or have questions. The page is structured in a way that allows customers to find answers quickly without needing to call support.

At the top of the page, there is a search bar. This allows users to type in keywords like “debit card,” “net banking,” or “limits.” When they type their query, the system searches through the knowledge base of frequently asked questions and provides the most relevant answers. On the right-hand side of the search bar, there is a button labeled “Ask bot.” This is designed to redirect the user to the AI chatbot, which can answer questions in a more conversational way, especially when FAQs do not fully address the issue.

Below the search bar, there are multiple categories presented as clickable tabs:

Debit cards – all questions related to card usage, PIN reset, blocking a lost card, transaction limits, etc.

Net banking – setup, login, enabling/disabling, password reset, etc.

Transfers – covers daily transfer limits, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, UPI issues, etc.

KYC & limits – information about account verification, daily transaction limits, documentation required, etc.

Loans – queries related to loan applications, repayments, interest rates, and closing a loan.

The Top Results section shows the most commonly searched and important questions:

How do I reset my debit card PIN?
The answer provides step-by-step instructions: Go to the Cards section → Select the specific card → Choose “Reset PIN” → The system sends an OTP (One-Time Password) to the registered mobile number → Enter OTP → Set a new PIN.

How can I increase my daily transfer limit?
The answer guides the user to open the Limits page → Select “Request Increase” → Submit request → Wait for approval, which normally takes 1–2 working days. Once approved, the user will get confirmation via SMS or email.

How do I enable net banking?
The process involves going to the Profile section → Navigating to Security settings → Enabling “Net banking” → Setting up a username and password for internet banking. This setup allows the user to perform online transactions securely.

The Help Center ensures that customers have clear, step-by-step solutions for the most frequent issues, reducing dependency on human agents and empowering users to resolve problems themselves.

3. Chat History Page

The Chat History page records and displays all past interactions between the user and the bank’s chatbot. This feature adds transparency and allows users to revisit old queries without having to ask the same question again.

At the top of this page, there are filters that make it easier to navigate the history. Users can:

Search specific queries using keywords.

Filter chats by confidence level (for example, showing only answers where the AI was ≥ 80% confident).

Select a date range, such as the last 30 days, to review only recent chats.

The chat history is shown in a table format with the following details:

Created – Timestamp of when the query was made. For example, “2025-08-10 14:12.”

Question – The exact text typed by the user, e.g., “Increase daily limit?”

Answer (snippet) – A shortened version of the AI’s response, such as “Go to Limits → Request increase…”

Confidence – A score between 0 and 1 showing how confident the AI was in its answer. For example, 0.92 (92% confident).

Ref – An internal reference code, such as FAQ IDs or KYC IDs, which map the question to a specific knowledge base entry.

Example:

On 2025-08-10 at 14:12, the user asked, “Increase daily limit?” The chatbot answered, “Go to Limits → Request increase…” with a confidence of 0.92. Reference ID: KYC-2025-142.

On 2025-08-09 at 10:05, the user asked, “Reset debit PIN.” The chatbot responded with, “Open Cards → Reset PIN…” with confidence 0.95. Reference ID: FAQ-34.

This page is not only useful for customers but also for administrators, who can monitor the chatbot’s performance, identify gaps, and improve the training data where confidence scores are low.

4. Profile & Security Page

The Profile & Security page is the central hub for managing account-related details and enhancing account protection. It is divided into three main sections:

A. Personal Information

Here, users can view and update their Full Name, Phone Number, and Email Address. These details are crucial as they are used for communication, verification, and recovery purposes. For example, if the user changes their phone number, OTPs and alerts will start going to the new number. After making any changes, the user must click the “Save changes” button to confirm updates.

B. Change Password

This section allows users to change their login password. To do this, the user must enter their Current Password, then type a New Password, and retype it in the Confirm field. This process ensures the user is authenticated before changing credentials. The system also enforces password policies such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

C. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This is an advanced security feature that adds another layer of protection beyond just the password. The user can toggle 2FA ON or OFF. When enabled, even if someone knows the password, they cannot log in without the second factor.

Methods:

Authenticator App – The system generates a QR code, which the user scans in an authentication app like Google Authenticator. This app then generates one-time codes that the user must enter at login.

Backup Codes – In case the user loses access to their authenticator app, they can download backup codes. Each code can be used once for login.

This ensures that the account is safe from unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised.

5. Active Sessions Page

The Active Sessions page provides transparency about which devices are currently logged into the user’s account. This is important for detecting suspicious activity and protecting the user from fraud.

The data is shown in a table with columns:

Device – The browser and platform, e.g., Chrome on Windows or Safari on iPhone.

IP Address – The unique identifier of the device on the internet, e.g., 203.0.113.45.

Location – City and country derived from the IP, e.g., Delhi, IN or Mumbai, IN.

Last Active – Time since the last login, e.g., “2 min ago” or “Yesterday.”

Token Expires – Expiry date of the login session.

Actions – The option to “Revoke” access for that specific device.

At the bottom, there is a red “Revoke all” button, which allows the user to instantly log out of every device. This is especially useful if the user suspects unauthorized access.

Example: If the user sees a login from a city they’ve never visited, they can revoke it immediately and change their password.

6. Loans Page

The Loans page shows the customer’s active and closed loans in detail. It is divided into two sections.

A. Your Loans

This section lists all loans in a table format. Each loan entry contains:

Loan ID – A unique identifier such as LN-10021.

Amount – The principal loan amount, e.g., $10,000.

Rate – The interest rate, e.g., 8.5%.

Start Date – The date the loan began.

End Date – The final repayment date.

Status – Whether the loan is Active or Closed.

For example:

Loan LN-10021: $10,000 loan, 8.5% interest, active from 2024-05-01 to 2027-05-01.

Loan LN-10005: $4,000 loan, 10% interest, active from 2023-01-20 to 2025-01-20, now closed.

B. Loan Details

When the user selects a specific loan, its details appear in the right panel. For example, selecting loan LN-10021 shows:

Principal: $10,000

Rate: 8.5%

Branch: 001

Next Payment Due: 2025-09-01

Amortization Schedule: A placeholder where the repayment schedule is displayed.

The user also has the option to click “Download schedule”, which provides a detailed breakdown of payments, including interest vs. principal components, due dates, and total remaining balance.

This feature makes loan tracking transparent, allowing customers to plan repayments without surprises.

✅ Usage for Chatbot Training

This document can now act as your knowledge base for chatbot fine-tuning.
Example questions it can answer:

“How do I add a new beneficiary?” → Walkthrough of Add Beneficiary page.

“Where can I check audit logs?” → Admin Dashboard > Audit logs section.

“What do I do if I see 403 error?” → Click “Request access”.

“How do I start a money transfer?” → Dashboard > New Transfer > Fill fields > Next.

👉 Bro, do you want me to continue building this long doc as you upload more UI pages, or should I already start compiling this into a single fine-tuning ready text file (like .txt or .md) for you?

You said:
long explanatinatory vrisoon not short pls
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 got it bro. You don’t want just a short structured doc, but a long, explanatory, step-by-step version that reads more like a full training manual / help center guide. This way, when you fine-tune your chatbot, it will be able to give detailed answers with reasoning and context, not just 2-line replies.

Here’s the expanded explanatory version of the same UI screens you shared:

📘 Digital Bank – Full Explanatory Documentation
1. Add Beneficiary Page

This page allows customers to securely add a new beneficiary to their account, which is a required step before transferring funds. A beneficiary is essentially the recipient of funds, and their details must be entered accurately.

Step-by-Step Process:

Navigate to Add Beneficiary

The customer clicks on the “Add beneficiary” option from the transfers or payments section.

A form appears with several fields that must be filled in.

Fill in Beneficiary Details

Name: Enter the full name of the person or business you want to send money to. The name should match the one registered with their bank.

Account Number: Enter the beneficiary’s bank account number. This is the most critical field since any error here may cause failed or misdirected transfers.

Bank: Provide the name of the bank where the beneficiary holds their account.

IFSC/SWIFT Code:

If the transfer is domestic, enter the IFSC code (Indian Financial System Code).

If the transfer is international, enter the SWIFT code, which is used for global transfers.

Description (Optional): This is an optional field where the customer can add notes. For example: “Rent payment” or “John – College fees.”

Submit or Cancel

Save (Blue Button): Clicking this will add the beneficiary to the customer’s account list. The beneficiary can then be selected during fund transfers.

Cancel (Grey Button): If the customer changes their mind, they can cancel without saving the details.

Error Handling and Verification:

If incorrect details are entered, the system may reject the addition or flag it for correction.

In some cases, an OTP (One-Time Password) or additional verification step may be triggered before the beneficiary is activated.

4. User Dashboard (Dark Mode)

This is the landing page after a customer logs in. It provides a summary of accounts, balances, and recent transactions.

Account Balances:

*Savings Account (*9910): Balance $15,230.00

Recent Transactions:

Lists recent customer transactions with date, merchant, and amount.

This helps customers quickly track their spending without going into detailed statements.

The next step will typically involve entering the amount, transfer reason, and confirmation with OTP.
